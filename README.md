## General Information
- In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.9.12
